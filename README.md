# Snake

The classic Snake game written in JavaScript.

### Gameplay
The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as you can. Every five seconds a green or red apple will appear randomly on the board. A green apple will give you 1 point, a red apple will give you 2 points and boost your speed for seven seconds.

You will lose if you Hit the edges of the board or run into yourself.

### Usage
Download the files and open `index.html` with your browser. `j`  is left, `k` is down, `l` is right, and `i` is up.

### But why?
My goal was to build Snake in 100 lines of JavaScript or less. You'll likely see _some_ unnecessary code optimizations or shortening to make this more concise.
